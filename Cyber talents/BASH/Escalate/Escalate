Challenge Description
	i think we need a new system admin :)  
	Note: - username: ctf  
          - password: ctf



# Writeup

>The challenge creates a URL for an UBUNTU Linux based machine. As I see, it request from me to be an admin then access the the root directory to catch the flag. The hint is "i think we need a new system admin :) "

- For example it gives me this URL > [http://wcam51xvkdclz049m2360nlbg301873o9q00bwvy-web.cybertalentslabs.com]
- This website gives me a temp access to an UBUNTU Linux based machine

# ***So let's have a look here***

>Firs of all I opened a kali Linux base machine to explore the URL.
>It prompt me a CLI to login to a machine "NO GUI".

##### So let's discover the machine

>First of all I tried "***ll***" command to discover the files
>![[Pasted image 20250508095059.png]]
 The output are some simple basic hidden files it won't help me at all.
>
 Then, I tried **_sudo -l_** as usual to discover my privileges and what can I do.![[Pasted image 20250508095342.png]]
> As shown, I can run two simple commands:
> ==/usr/bin/python3== that is for a python3 libraries that I can run python3 scripts on this machine easily.
> ==/opt/cool.py== is a .py file that's maybe includes a python script.
> Also, I can see ==(root) SETENV: NOPASSWD:== . 
>   So, what’s that ==SETENV:== does ? 
> 	- Basically it gives you the ability to set environment variables "I think it will help me to get to root directory"
> With that in mind let’s see the content of the cool.py 

##### cool.py discovery

> Let's discover ==cool.py== by applying " ***cat /opt/cool.py*** "
> ![[Pasted image 20250508100349.png]]
> So it imports a module in python3 called “pyfiglet”, then takes whatever input you give and outputs it in a big text. No matter what input I will provide, it will give it to me in BIG TEXT like this. 
> I will use ==/usr/bin/python3== "that I already have access to as I mentioned before" to run the script  ==/opt/cool.py== that I have a privilege to run using this command " python3 /opt/cool.py " and type anything to test the script.

## Pythonpath

>**Pythonpath** is **a special environment variable that provides guidance to the Python interpreter about where to find various libraries and applications**.
>So, we can use Pythonpath environment variable to include a directory where we have write access. "/tmp/payload". So, Python can imports modules from this directory.
>I used this command " ***mkdir /tmp/payload*** " to create a directory to use it with Pythonpath.
>After this step, I will append a command in my payload " ***import os; os.system(“/bin/sh”)*** " to use it with ==/opt/cool.py== that I have privilege to use it by these steps.
- mkdir /tmp/payload
- echo ‘import os; os.system(“/bin/sh”)’ > /tmp/payload/pyfiglet.py
>Noted that: 
>- " ***import os; os.system(“/bin/sh”)*** ". This command is used to import a modular called OS to use OS files to excite from /bin/sh file. That will help us to get to the flag in the root directory.

### Run the script

>To run the script I will use "***==sudo==***" to run it easily, 
>I will use ***PYTHONPATH*** to get the created payload script " ***pyfiglet.py*** " from " ***mkdir /tmp/payload*** ". now it can understand the path that python can search to use it as an input. ==PYTHONPATH=/tmp/payload==
>I will use **==/usr/bin/python3==** to run the script. "I already have a privilege to use it"
>I will use **==/opt/cool.py==** to get input from " ***pyfiglet.py*** " that I was mentioned using  ***PYTHONPATH***.  "I already have a privilege to use it"
>So, the command will be like this:
>***==sudo PYTHONPATH=/tmp/payload /usr/bin/python3 /opt/cool.py==***
>![[Pasted image 20250508122211.png]]
>Now I can execute some commands using  ==(root) SETENV: NOPASSWD:==
>So, let's discover the root directory using ***==ls -al /root==***
>![[Pasted image 20250508122306.png]]
>That is our flag
>I can see what it contains using ***==cat  /root/flag.txt==***
